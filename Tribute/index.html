                <h3>Info about Carl Fredricksen - One of the main actors in the movie UP</h3>
                
                <p>Carl is the protagonist in the Pixar film called "Up". In his early childhood he met an adventurous girl named Ellie. 
                    Carl and Ellie grew up together, got married and repeatedly pooled there savings for a trip to the Paradise Falls.
                    (a travel destination Ellie confided to Carl as her biggest desire) Years passed by and just as it seemed they were 
                    able to take the trip, Ellie got sick and died. Carl living by himself becomes bitter and cranky as a cause of missing
                    his wife terribly. 
                    As time goes by, the city grew around Carl´s old house and real estate sharks want Carl to sell his house and leave the place. But Carl refused and responded with dry sarcasm:
                 </p>
                    <blockquote>"Tell your boss he can have our house!"..."When I'm dead!"</blockquote>
                 <p>
                    Someday a construction vehicle damaged Carl´s mailbox and he got into a rage by struggling with a construction worker. In consequence of this clash a court labeled Carl as a public menace and odered him to move into a retirement home. By keeping his mind off moving into the retirement center, Carl planned to hold his promise to Ellie. With the help of a selfmade aircraft composed of seamed bed sheets, ropes, 10,000 heliums balloons and his old house, he took off into a journey to the Paradise Falls.
                    If you want to know more about Carl´s adventure then take a look at the following trailer or read the <a id="tribute-link" href="http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/Carl_Fredricksen" target="_blank">Pixar Wiki entry</a> about him.
